# Summary
In one shared VM, we might want to avoid user1 mounting volume of user2 for security concerns

# Details
How we can achieve that?

## Docker-in-Docker with sock file mounted

Doesn't work, since inside the container, "docker ps" can see other containers.

```
docker run --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --name dockerd-sockfile -d getintodevops/jenkins-withdocker:lts
docker exec -it dockerd-sockfile sh

docker ps

# With sockfile mounted, inside the container, "docker ps" show all containers. So the segregation doesn't work

## Docker-in-Docker without sock file mounted

https://hub.docker.com/_/docker/

```
docker run -t -d -h mytest --name container-outside --entrypoint=/bin/sh "nginx"

docker run --privileged --name docker-in-docker -d docker:stable-dind
docker exec -it docker-in-docker sh

# Inside the container, start a new container
docker run -t -d -h mytest --name my-test --entrypoint=/bin/sh "nginx"

docker ps
## Previously we have started a container(container-outside). Inside current container, docker ps won't show it.

## ABAC support for volumes

ABAC: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/abac/

Specify one volume can only be mounted by one specific user.
```
1. Add attributes/metadata to volumes.
2. Then the scheduling engine(dockerd, k8s schedule) load the volume, before starting pods/containers.
3. If it's not allowed, pods/containers refue to start.
```

Note: currently k8s volumes doesn't support ABAC
